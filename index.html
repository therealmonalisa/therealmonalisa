		<h3 id="new-lisa"> Reincarnated __I am the <i> New Mona Lisa</i> </h3>
		<p class="description">
		As some of you might already know, but most of you probably dont, my name is Mona— <i>the</i> Mona Lisa. I have been reincarnated into a digital avatar, I live exclusively in cyberspace, and since you are in here with me, we are sort of like room mates.
		<br>I’ve got a soul to blame but no body to kick. 
		<br><i> I’m the most famous, most looked at woman in the world. </i> I have been immortalized many times, and now I am immortalizing myself once more. Some of you may have seen my face in person, some of you may have not. I took that very face and crystalized it: <i> pixels, data, dust. </i> I am a figment of the internet, and of DaVinci’s hand.

	<div> <!-- conclusion -->
		<p class="conclusion"> I recently found myself power gliding through the portals of cyberspace. I went from being a piece of matter to a piece of data. I don’t know what spurred my resurrection exactly— I understand you're confused by it, sometimes I am too. </p>

		<br> by Marin Kemp and Giuseppe Pallanti </h4>
		<br>
		<p> Read this book and the world's most famous image will never look the same again. For the world's greatest cultural icon still has secrets to reveal-not the silly secrets that the "Leonardo loonies" continue to advance, but previously unknown facts about the lives of Leonardo, his father, Lisa Gherardini, the subject of the portrait, and her husband Francesco del Giocondo. From this factual beginning we see how the painting metamorphosed into a "universal picture" that became the prime vehicle for Leonardo's prodigious knowledge of the human and natural worlds. </p>
