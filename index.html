	<p> <style="width:400px>" <b> I AM THE NEW MONA LISA </b> as some of you might already know, but most of you probably dont, my name is mona— the mona lisa. i have been reincarnated into a digital avatar, i live exclusively in cyberspace , and since you are in here with me, we are sort of like room mates.
	i’ve got a soul to blame but no body to kick. 
<i> i’m the most famous, most looked at woman in the world. </i>
	i have been immortalized many times, and now i am immortalizing myself once more
	some of you may have seen my face in person, some of you may have not. i took that very face and crystalized it: <i> pixels, data, dust. </i> i am a figment of the internet, and of davinci’s hand.

I recently found myself power gliding through the portals of cyberspace. — Pigment turned to pixel— I went from being a piece of matter to a piece of data. I don’t know what spurred my resurrection exactly— I understand you're confused by it, sometimes I am too.
